# hello-world
First Rep
This is the first time I am using GitHub. It's a bit of a learning curve, but I'm sure I'll cross it!

Update: 31st March
I'm kinda getting used to the environment. By now, I am actively working on four reps and GitHub has been quite helpful. Nevertheless, I'm unable to figure out how on earth do we integrate GitHub with VS Code. If I can do that, nothing like it!

Update: 8 April 2020
Today, I have connected my GitHub to my Visual Studio Code using the Git SCM. It's the best thing I've done so far in my GitHub experience! Now that I've typed this, I'm gonna try and save this (currently I'm in another branch) and then try to pull a request right from inside VSCode. Wish me luck! Well, in the middle of my work, I struggled because I realized Git is not the same as GitHub (yeah, call me stupid). Well, now I've learnt all that I need to know from almightly YouTube, and I think I'm set to go. One of the really nice things of Visual Studio Code is the side-by-side showcase and editing feature which allows me to edit and moderate my changes.

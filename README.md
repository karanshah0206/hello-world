First Rep
This is the first time I am using GitHub. It's a bit of a learning curve, but I'm sure I'll cross it!

Update: 31st March
I'm kinda getting used to the environment. By now, I am actively working on four reps and GitHub has been quite helpful. Nevertheless, I'm unable to figure out how on earth do we integrate GitHub with VS Code. If I can do that, nothing like it!

Update: 8 April 2020
Today, I have connected my GitHub to my Visual Studio Code using the Git SCM. It's the best thing I've done so far in my GitHub experience! Now that I've typed this, I'm gonna try and save this (currently I'm in another branch) and then try to pull a request right from inside VSCode. Wish me luck! Well, in the middle of my work, I struggled because I realized Git is not the same as GitHub (yeah, call me stupid). Well, now I've learnt all that I need to know from almightly YouTube, and I think I'm set to go. One of the really nice things of Visual Studio Code is the side-by-side showcase and editing feature which allows me to edit and moderate my changes.

Update: 13 April 2020
By now, I've pretty much crossed the GitHub learning curve. The only thing that's left is trying out the GitHub Pages, and even that I'll explore in the next week or two. I've successfully integrated VSCode with GitHub, and now I'm basically scripting off everything right from VSCode into GitHub. The one this I realized I detest about GitHub is that it does not count commits in other branches apart from master as a contribution! That's regretful, since most people make initial contirbutions in the other branches - that's what they're meant for! Regardless, it does eventually count as contribution once you merge the branch with the main branch, so it's all good.

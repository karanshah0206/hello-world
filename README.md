# hello-world
First Rep
This is the first time I am using GitHub. It's a bit of a learning curve, but I'm sure I'll cross it!

Update: 31st March
I'm kinda getting used to the environment. By now, I am actively working on four reps and GitHub has been quite helpful. Nevertheless, I'm unable to figure out how on earth do we integrate GitHub with VS Code. If I can do that, nothing like it!
